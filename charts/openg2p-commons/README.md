# OpenG2P Social Registry Helm Chart

This helm contains the following components:

- PostgreSQL
- Mail SMTP server
- MinIO
- Keymanager
- OpenSearch
- Reporting (Reporting Framework + Reporting Init)
- Superset
- eSignet (eSignet + Mock Identity System)
Note: Helm chart versions lower than 2.x.x were split into two parts. For versions 2.x.x and higher, there is only a single chart that installs all the required components. No need to install P2.
